Below two images were given in this challenge. ( whereami.bmp and xor-gate-symbol.jpg)

`xor-gate-symbol.jpg` this name was giving me a hint of combining images in `StegSolve`, but doing so with given images was not giving any output.
So I tried binwalk on both images.

OK, so I can see two JPEG files, let's try to extract it.

So you can see that, there is this image

So simply rename this file with `jpeg` extension.

Now open `whereami.bmp` in `StegSolve` and select `exctracted.jpeg` using `Image combiner` option.
So you will see below output.

You can see the flag on the left side, but it's not readable.
I took a screenshot of it for better visibility.

`nbCTF{n0_on3_i5_saf3}` is the flag.
